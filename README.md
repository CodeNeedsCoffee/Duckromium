# Duckromium
Chromium with integrated DuckDuckGo features.
This is my first major Project and if I'm being honest, not entirely sure what I'm doing, but thanks for joing me on the ride.

## Getting Started

I'm using Visual Studio 2019 (Preview) and following the directions from [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md).

### Prerequisites

Not entirely sure yet, still working there.

```
Welp.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that will exist after the first release.

```
Do something.
```

And then

```
Do something else kind of cool.
```

Bam, you're good homie.


## Deployment

We all love some good msi's.
